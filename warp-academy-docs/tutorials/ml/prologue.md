In the context of technological advancements, **AI** and **blockchain** are often regarded as distinct domains.
However, the combination of these two technologies presents a unique opportunity to address real-world data management
and computation challenges.

By envisioning a world where AI models become transparent and their training data and code are easily accessible,
we can leverage the integration of smart contracts platforms and AI libraries.

This approach establishes a decentralized and verifiable system capable of addressing issues such as
[data gravity](appendix#explain-what-data-gravity-means)
(say hello to a decentralized storage on Arweave), dishonest computation, and limitations of traditional internet
money services (tokenize high quality data feeds, tokenize computational resources).

In this tutorial, we will examine a practical example of this synergistic collaboration by constructing
a smart contract with a neural network trained to predict Bitcoin prices.
