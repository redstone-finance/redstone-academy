# Internals

Warp-Syncer is a collection of services, each implemented as a command in one Golang binary. Internally all those services are a collection of `Tasks` connected by Golang channels.


## Tasks
`Task` is our internal abstraction for a unit of work. A Task manages its own state, spawns goroutines, receives data from input channels and sends data to output channels. 

:::info
For instance, the `TransactionDownloader` task retrieves Arweave transactions from a single block. It has an input channel where it receives new blocks and an output channel where it sends transactions. It downloads transactions in parallel using a pool of goroutines.

Tasks form the foundational elements of any Warp-Syncer service. They are set up in `controller.go` in each service's folder. Tasks are embeddable - a task can be used as a building block for another task. For example, the entry point of the application is a `Task` that spawns other tasks and connects them together.

:::info
`Task` primitives are defined in `./src/utils/task/*.go` files.
